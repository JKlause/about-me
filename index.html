            Well here it is, all the information you never wanted to know about Joe.
            I'd say there is nothing revolutionary about to happen. But heck, I don't know.
            I'm writing these paragraphs as I am in coding class, and I frankly just need
            to get some words down really fast in order to move on to the css. But maybe
            some good stuff is going to come out. Stream of consciousness you know?!

            Well first and foremost. That is a terrible picture of me. And if were in my
            class, you would know why! I took the picture on my photobooth application, but
            the sound was on. LOUD. So obviously it was a slightly embarassing moment. For which
            I had to apologize for. Good moment. I try to always silence my computer (like my cell phone)
            whenever I enter class. Obviously I forgot this time.

            Well all the coding of that unordered list just made me lose my place. Let's talk about
            vacations! I want to go on vacation. You may be saying, "But Joe, yout just started school.
            How could you imagine going on vacation now?" And I would say, "That's the perfect time to 
            start thinking about it!" It's just starting to get unbearably warm in PDX. Not today, but I feel
            it. It's coming. You Just freakin wait. And the PEARL! UGH... super hot. I know it will be.
            I worry about these things. So! If I were going on vacation RIGHT NOW! These would be my top choices
            in order: 
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Victoria, BC</li>
            <li>Aspen, CO</li>
            <li>Anywhere in Hawaii</li>
        </ol>
